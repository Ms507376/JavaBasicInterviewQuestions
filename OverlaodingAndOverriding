 What is method overloading in java ?
  Method overlaoding : It is process  of declaring two methods with same but but different method signature.
                     : It is performed within same class.
                     : No of arguments should be different / data type should be differrnt.
                     : Method Overloading ( Compile time Polymorphism).Overloaded method calls are resolved at compile time.
   Example :  class Youspeaking
                { 
         	void talk(Stranger obj) 
	               { 
		              sysout("Hi, my day was great!"); 
               	} 
	        void talk(Beloved obj) 
	              { 
		              sysout("Hi, my day was great! You won't believe what happened today! Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah! "); 
	              } 
            }                 
                     
    Method Overriding : Method overriding ia the process of defining same method with different code in different class.
                      : Overriding is based on runtime polymorphism and method calls are resolved at runtime.
                      : No of arguments should be same.Is - A relationship.
