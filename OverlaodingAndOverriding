1)  What is method overloading in java ?
  Method overloading : It is process  of declaring two methods with same name but different method signature.
                     : It is performed within same class.
                     : No of arguments should be different / data type should be differrnt.
                     : Method Overloading ( Compile time Polymorphism).Overloaded method calls are resolved at compile time.
   Example :  class Youspeaking
                { 
         	void talk(Stranger obj) 
	               { 
		              sysout("Hi, my day was great!"); 
               	} 
	        void talk(Beloved obj) 
	              { 
		              sysout("Hi, my day was great! You won't believe what happened today! Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah! "); 
	              } 
            }                 
                     
    Method Overriding : Method overriding ia the process of defining same method with different code in different class.
                      : Overriding is based on runtime polymorphism and method calls are resolved at runtime.
                      : No of arguments should be same.Is - A relationship.
                      
 2)   Why is Method overloading not possible by changing the return type in Java?
        Method overloading it is not psossible by changing return type of program due to the ambiguity ( Here,which method to call ambiguity).
       class adder
       static int add(int a, int b)
       {
          return a + b;
       }
       
       static double add( int a,int b)
       {
          return a + b ;   
       }
     }
     
  3 ) Differnece between method overloading and overriding ?
      Overloading : Within same class.
                  : Compile time Polymorphism.
		          : Static method can be overloaded.
		          : Argument List should be different.
      Overriding  :In Different class.
                  : Run time Polymorphism.
		          : Static method can not be overrided.
		          : Argument List should be some.
		  
  4 ) Can we overload static method in java ?
      yes ,it's possible to overload static method in java.
      we can define as many as static method  within same class until all of them have different method signature(Means Either No. of arguments should
      be different or data type of arguments should be different) .
      
  5) Can We override static method in Java ?
     We can not override static method in java as Static method are resolved at compile time But override is runtime activity .
  
  6) Can we override private method in java ?
     No,we can not override private method in java as it belongs to  object class and it is not visible outside of calss and we can not inherit them.
  
  7) Can we override a non static method as static in Java ?
     No ,it's not possible to define a non static method of same name as static method in parent class ,It will give compile time error in Java.
     
  8) Can we override a constructor in Java?
     No ,we can not override a constructor in java beacuse they are not inherited .
     We Can overload constructor( Default constructor / Parameterized Constructor ) but we can not override them .
     
 9) Can we override final method in java ?
    No ,we can not override final method in java .If we try to override the final method in Java it will throw compile time error .
    
 10 ) Can we overload or override main method in java ?
      Main method is static method in java and it follows the rule associated with static method so  Main method can be overloaded but can not be overrided.
      
 11 ) How to call satic method and non static method in java ?
       Static method     ---> Classname.method name 

        public class MathUtils {
    // Static method
    public static int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calling the static method using the Class Name
        int result = MathUtils.calculateSum(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Sum is: " + result); // Output: Sum is: 30
    }
}



       Non Static Method ---> we create object of a calss then call the method
       // Syntax:
        ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
        objectName.nonStaticMethodName(arguments);
