1)  What is the Collection framework in Java?
     Collection Framework is a combination of classes and interface, which is used to store and manipulate the data in the form of objects.
     
2)  What are the interfaces present in collection ?
    List ,Set and Map these are the interfaces in java .
    List and Set interface  Extends Collection interface But Map does not extend collection interface as it is based on key value pair.
    
3) which All classes implement the List interface?
    ArrayList,Vector and LinkedList these  three classes implements the List Interface.All these three classes provide an ordered collection of objects and   
    allow duplicate values.
    
    Arraylist : It is a class which implements the List interface .
              : Fast iteration and fast random access( becuase it works at the index basis) .
              : It is ordered by index but not sorted in nature.
              : It allows duplicate element.
              : It's better for storing and accessing the data.
              
              Synatx :
              ArrayList<String> ar = new ArrayList<String>();
              ar.add(" Moni ");
              
              // Traversing in arraylist 
              Iterator itr=ar.iterator();
              while(itr.hasNext())
              {
                System.out.println(itr.next());
              }
              
   Vector   :   It's same as arrayList the only difference is method of vector are ( synchronized and thread safe).
            :   we should prefer Arraylist over Vector if thread safety is not required.
              
   LinkedList : It is a class which implements the List interface .  
              : Ordered by index same as arraylist .
              : It is double linked to each other because of which we can add / remove the element from both side(Because of this reason iteration is little bit slow).
              : Insertion and deletion is much more faster than arraylist.
               
              
4 )    Which all classes implement set interface ?
       Hashset ,TreeSet ,LinkedHashSet these three classes implements the set interface.
       Set it doesn't permit duplicate value.
       
       TreeSet      :It is a class which implements set interface
                    :It is a sorted  and ordered set by default order will be ascending order.
                    : retrieval of data  and access is faster .
       HashSet      :It is a class which implements set interface.
                    :It is unsorted and unordered set .
       LinkedHashSet:It is a class which implements set interface.
                    :It is ordered version of HashSet.
                    
5) List and Set difference ?
   List allows duplicate element but set doesn't allow the duplicate element.
   List allows as many as null element but Set allows only one null element.
   
6) List all classes of Map interface .
   HashMap,Hashtable,TreeMap.
   Hashmap : It is unsorted and unorderd Collection.It stores data in Key-Value pair.
           : HashMap allows only one null key and multiple null values
           : HashMap is non synchronized and It is not-thread safe.
           
           Syntax : 
           HashMap<Integer,String> hm = new HashMap<Integer,String>(); 
           
           for (Map.entry<Integer ,String> m : hm.entrySet() )
                 {
                    System.out.println("Key = " + m.getKey() + ",Value = " + m.getValue());
                 }                   

7) Difference between Hashtable and Hashmap ?
    HashMap is non synchronized and It is not-thread safe  whereas Hashtable is synchronized and thread safe.
    HashMap allows only one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
    
8) Difference between list and ArrayList ?
   List is an iterface and Arralist is a class which implements the List interface.
   In List Length is fixed and we can not resize it but in Arraylist length is dynamic in nature an we can resize it.
   
9) Arrays and arraylist difference ?
    Arrays are Created of fixed size  whereas ArrayList is not of fixed size.
    Arrays size can not be incremented or Decremented but arraylist size we can increment or decrement.
    Arrays are multidimensional but Arraylist is one dimensional.
    Once array is created we can't add / remove the element but in arrayList we can add/remove the element.
