1) Difference between Hashtable and Hashmap ?
    HashMap is non synchronized.It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code whereas Hashtable is synchronized.
    HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
