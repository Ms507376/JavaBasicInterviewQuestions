1) What is inheritance ?
   Inheritance is an object oriented feature which allows a class to inherit method and data from other class or we can say accquiring 
   properties of parent class in child class.
   
   Use of Inheritance :
   For Method Overriding / Code Reusablity.
   
   
2) What are different types of inheritance supported by Java ?
   Java supports single inheritance , Multi-level inheritance , Hierarchical inheritance.
    Multiple inheritance is not supported by class ,it can be implemented using interface.
    
3) Why Mutiple inheritance is not supported by Java?
   Multiple inheritance is not supported by java.
   Consider a scenario where A,B and C are three classes. The C class inherits  A and B class. If A and B classes have Same Method and 
   we call it from Child class object ,there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
   Class A 
   {
      void msg ()
      {
        System.out.println( " run A"); 
      }
   }
   
   Class B
   {
     void msg () 
     { 
         System.out.println( " run B");         
     }   
   }
   
   Class C extends A,B 
   {
      C obj = new C();
      obj.msg(); // while Calling method of class A and B there will be ambiguity which method should be called 
   }
  
  
4) What is  Inheritance , Encapsulation and abstraction with real time examples?
   Inheritance   :Accquiring properties of Parent Class in Child class is called Inheritance.( we inherit properties from our ancestor).
   Encapsulation :Wrapping of data and method together in a single unit is called Encapsulation.
                 :It is used to hide internal details of class.
   Abstraction   :Process of hiding the implementation details from users.Only Functionality will be provided to users.
                  e.g ( ATM (We enter 4 digit pin ) while withdrawing the money but we don't know the implemenation ).
                  
5) What is polymorphism ?
   Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different way.
   Compile time polymorphism ,Run time polymorphism.
   Compile time polymorphism :
