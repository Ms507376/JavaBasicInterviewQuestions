1) What is Exception ?
   An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of program.
   
2) Difference between error and exception ?
    Error and Exception Both are subclasses of throwable class.
    Error    : Error mostly occur at Runtime( Unchecked type) 
               e.g (System crash error and Out of memory error) 
    
    Exception:Exceptions are the problems which occur and Compile time and runtime both and can be handled by using try catch block .
              Nullpointer exception, Arithmetic Exception.
              
3) Type oF Exception ?
   Checked Exception   : checked exceptions are checked at compile-time
   Eg. ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException,FileNotFound Exception
   
   Unchecked Exception :Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.
   E.g  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,Airthmetic Exception,NULL pointer exception.
      
4)  Throw and Throws keyword difference ?
     Throw  :Throw is a keyword which is used to throw an exception explicitly in the program inside a function or inside a block of code.
            :we cannot throw multiple exceptions.
            :Throw is not used for checked Exception 
     Throws :Throws is a keyword which is used in the method signature used to declare an exception which might get thrown by the function while executing the code.
            :Throws keyword is required only for checked exception.
            :We Can Throw multiple exceptions using Throws
               e.g public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.
               
5 ) Try - Catch Block ?
      Try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.It must be used within the method.
      catch block is used to handle the Exception by declaring the type of exception within the parameter.
      The catch block must be used after the try block only.we can use multiple catch block with a single try block.
      public class TryCatchExample2 {  
            public static void main(String[] args) {  
        try  
        {  
        int data=50/0; //may throw exception   
        }  
            //handling the exception  
        catch(ArithmeticException e)  
        {  
            System.out.println(e);  
        }  
        System.out.println("rest of the code");  
    }  
   }  
6)  What is throwable class ?
    The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the Java language.
    
7) what is Java finally block ?
  Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection,stream etc.
  Java finally block is always executed whether exception is handled or not.
  Java finally block follows try or catch block.
  e.g 
  class TestFinallyBlock{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  try{  
   int data=25/5;  
   System.out.println(data);  
  }  
  catch(NullPointerException e){System.out.println(e);}  
  finally{System.out.println("finally block is always executed");}  
  System.out.println("rest of the code...");  
  }  
}
